## Convolutional Neural Networks]

Fields: 

- Voice User Interfaces
- Natural Language Processing 
- Computer Vision

In computer vision, CNN's allows to extract certain features from your image and summarize the content on the image to classify it.

Feature extraction about sentiment in NLP. 

### Notebooks: 

- [Multi-Layer Perceptron, MNIST](#mnist_mlp_exercise.ipynb): train an MLP to classify MNIST database. 
- [Train an MLP - MNIST using Validation](#mnist_mlp_solution_with_validation.ipynb), to train the classifier and evaluate the model using validation dataset
- [Custom filters](#custom_filters.ipynb), learn how to create filters for a cnn.
- [Learn how to apply filters to your own CNN](#conv_visualization.ipynb)
- [Train a CIFAR classifier](#cifar10_cnn_exercise.ipynb), using convolutions and max pooling layers into a model
- [Learn about max pooling](#maxpooling_visualization.ipynb), create your own max pooling layers and apply it to your images in your model
- [Adding data augmentation to your model](#cifar10_cnn_augmentation.ipynb)
