## Lessons Overview

Checkout the resources and notebooks on each lesson.

### [Lesson 1](#l1_cnns): Convolutional Neural Net

- How they work?
- Why they are top performers vs. MLP's? 
- What are Filters, High Pass Filters. 
- How to do Edge Handling. 

### [Lesson 3](#l3_transfer_learning): Transfer Learning

Learn how to apply Transfer Learning based on what you have and what would you like to achieve.
 
In this lesson, you could check out few lessons about how size of the dataset and similarity with the trained model play an important role when applying Transfer Learning
